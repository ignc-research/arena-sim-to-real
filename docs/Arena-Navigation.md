Plan manager
* plan_manager_node will init a ros node for plan_manager
* plan_manager is implemented as a Finite State Machine
* plan_manager is responsible for state transfer, ros communication and call plan functions from plan_collecor

Plan collector
* plan_collector has no ros communication tasks, plan_collecor only responsible for algorithms
* plan_collector calls libraries from other pkgs(e.g. pkgs in mapping, local planner, global planner) to achieve its functions
* plan_collector also responsible for subgoal generation, which is the job of intermediate planner.

Plan msgs
* saves user-defined msg or srv for arena navigation


#### 3.3. Simulator: Flatland
[Flatland](https://github.com/avidbots/flatland) is a 2D physical simulator based on box2D, which is made to be integratable with ROS and easy to extend functions with its plugin mechanism.

In our project, we have modified and extended the original Flatland source repositary in order to make it better suitable to our DRL planning purpose. The parts that have been modified will be cleared somehow in following sections.

A great introduction to flatland is listed in following website, please checi it out (most importantly in order to know how to create plugin in flatland):
* How to use flatland: http://flatland-simulator.readthedocs.io

Things need to know:
* How flatland updates its simulation progress
* How to write model .yaml files for flatland
* How to create flatland plugins(e.g. laser, driver, motion behavior) which can be added to the model .yaml file


##### How flatland updates its simulation progress
````
flatland_server/src/flatland_server_node.cpp
flatland_server/src/simulation_manager.cpp         (modified by our project)
flatland_server/src/world.cpp
flatland_server/src/timekeeper.cpp
flatland_plugins/src/laser.cpp                     (modified by our project)
````
check out these files, everything relative to simulation update is contained there.
We made some modification in *simulation_manager.cpp*, where we create a */step_world* service server.

##### How to write model .yaml files for flatland
Robot, Obstacles and world can be described by .yaml files, which provide easy setting to users.

check out the model section in http://flatland-simulator.readthedocs.io

##### How to create flatland plugins
Sensors such as laser, actuator such ad diff_driver & other user defined motion behaviors can be coded as a flatland plugin and added to the model .yaml file.

check out the plugin section in http://flatland-simulator.readthedocs.io

````
flatland_plugins/src/laser.cpp                     (modified by our project)
flatland_plugins/src/diff_drive.cpp                (modified by our project)
flatland_plugins/src/model_tf_publisher.cpp        (modified by our project)
flatland_plugins/include/flatland_plugins/tween.h  (for dynamic obstacle motion behavior)
flatland_plugins/include/flatland_plugins/update_timer.h
````
These are the plugins that currently we are using and some of them are modified.

Modification are mostly done in these two functions in each plugins.
These change are made intended to make the publication of topics done in *AfterPhysicsStep* otherthan in *BeforePhysicsStep*.

````
void BeforePhysicsStep(const Timekeeper& timekeeper);
void AfterPhysicsStep(const Timekeeper &timekeeper) ;
````

#### 3.4. Task Generator
To be added...

#### 3.5. Utils
contains rviz_plugins & planning visulizations needed to be showed in rviz.
